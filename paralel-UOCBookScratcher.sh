# Book stealer from UOC (Open University of Catalonia) v. 1.0.						#
# Author: Aleix Marin√© (aleix.marine@estudiants.urv.cat).						#
#													#
# This script downloads all files pointed by a link from PDF and material section in UOC website. If	#
# the file is empty, the file generated will be erased; so, only valid files will be kept. This script 	#
# will go through all links with id from 1 to 9999999. This last number is arbitrary, so possibly more 	#
# files can be found beyond this number.								#
#													#
# Files will be saved in the folder "books", created in the same location as this script. In this 	    #
# location, you can also find the file "dades.txt", which contains the last id link number consulted. 	#
# The script will start downloading from this number. You can modify this value in "dades.txt" with a 	#
# number within 1 to 9999999. The file "links.txt" contains all links consulted pointing to valid files.#
# Keep this file for future references.									                                #
#													                                                    #
# For executing this file you need to give execution permission to this script. This can be done with 	#
# chmod utility in most unix system: Open a terminal in the ubication of this script and write:		#
# chmod 777 uocbookscratcher.sh										#
# 													#
# For executing the script open a console and set it in the ubication of this script (same as before)	#
# and write:												#
# ./uocbookscratcher.sh											#
